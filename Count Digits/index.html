    <!-- Suppose we have an integer d between 0 and 9, we also have two positive integers low and high as lower and upper bounds, respectively. We have to find the number of times that d occurs as a digit in all integers between low and high, including the bounds low and high.

    For example, d=2, low= 10, high = 23 then the output will be 6, as digit d = 2 occurs 6 times: 12, 20, 21, 22, 23. -->
